Assigment project for DBMS and Object and Aspect Programming courses at university.

Tracker written in Java utilising SQLite databse made tracking progress in an MMORPG called Elsword. Mainly used to save data about progress, also got an optimalising module using genetical algorytm exported and also used in a different project. Here it isn't too useful due to amount of variables that need to be used. Usually it's easier for player to think themselves what to do. Project has some temporary portability issues I've been gradually sorting out in my free time.
